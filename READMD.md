# Customer churn prediction

Customer churn prediction is a critical task in the financial services industry. In this example, we'll use Python and scikit-learn to build a simple customer churn prediction model using synthetic customer behavior data. Real-world models require extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and business insights.

In this code:

*  We load a simplified synthetic customer behavior dataset with features like age, transaction count, average transaction amount, whether the customer has a credit card, and a binary target variable where 0 indicates no churn, and 1 indicates churn.

*  We split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y) and further split them into training and testing sets.

* We create a Random Forest Classifier, train it on the training data, and make predictions on the test data.

*  Finally, we evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.

Real-world customer churn prediction models involve more extensive data and often incorporate advanced techniques such as feature engineering, model tuning, and customer segmentation. Additionally, you should use actual customer data and consider privacy and regulatory considerations when working with customer information.
